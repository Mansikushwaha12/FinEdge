# Design and Development Process:

### Understanding the Requirements
I started by carefully reading and understanding the requirements of the project, which included designing and developing a single-page website for the fictitious fintech startup "FinEdge" using the Astro framework.

### Planning the Structure: 
I planned the website structure by identifying the required components such as the navigation bar, home section, about us section, services section, and contact us section.

I also performed debugging to fix any issues or errors that arose during the development process.

### Challenges Faced and Overcoming Them:

I don't no Astro framework so I decide to use React 
## Responsive Design:
Designing and developing a responsive website that looks and functions well across different devices can be challenging. To overcome this, I followed responsive design principles, used CSS media queries to adjust styles based on screen size, and tested the website on various devices to ensure responsiveness.
